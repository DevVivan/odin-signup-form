# Sign-up Form

Well, this was a fun one. This was the `sign-up form`, the [*6th project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) within the Odin Project curriculum that focused on students practising form basics, and form validation skills alongside the learning made in many other previous lessons.
